The presence of hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds in fuel and other gases has long been of concern for both the users and the producers of such gases. In addition to the corrosive and other adverse effects that such impurities have upon equipment and processes, noxious emissions are commonly produced from combustion of the natural gas as a result of oxidation of the sulfur compounds. The resulting sulfur oxides can be a major contributor to air pollution and may have detrimental impact upon the environment. Increasingly stringent federal and state regulations have accordingly been promulgated in an effort to reduce or eliminate sulfurous emissions, and a concomitant interest exists in efficiently removing from natural gas and the like the hydrogen sulfide that comprises a significant precursor of noxious emissions. In addition, one method of disposing of hydrogen sulfide has been to convert it into solid sulfur, for storage. Due to environmental and aesthetic concerns, many countries are now outlawing the formation of such sulfur stores.\nEnhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) may be used to increase oil recovery in fields worldwide. There are three main types of EOR, thermal, chemical/polymer and gas injection, which may be used to increase oil recovery from a reservoir, beyond what can be achieved by conventional means\u2014possibly extending the life of a field and boosting the oil recovery factor.\nThermal enhanced recovery works by adding heat to the reservoir. The most widely practised form is a steamdrive, which reduces oil viscosity so that it can flow to the producing wells. Chemical flooding increases recovery by reducing the capillary forces that trap residual oil. Polymer flooding improves the sweep efficiency of injected water. Miscible gas injection works in a similar way to chemical flooding. By injecting a fluid that is miscible with the oil, trapped residual oil can be recovered.\nReferring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated prior art system 100. System 100 includes underground formation 102, underground formation 104, underground formation 106, and underground formation 108. Production facility 110 is provided at the surface. Well 112 traverses formations 102 and 104, and terminates in formation 106. The portion of formation 106 is shown at 114. Oil and gas are produced from formation 106 through well 112, to production facility 110. Gas and liquid are separated from each other, gas is stored in gas storage 116 and liquid is stored in liquid storage 118. Gas in gas storage 116 may contain hydrogen sulfide, which must be processed, transported, disposed of, or stored.\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,149,344 discloses that acid gas, containing hydrogen sulfide, is liquified by compression and cooling, mixed with water under pressure and flowed into a disposal well. U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,344 is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\nThere is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for processing, transportation, disposal, or storage of hydrogen sulfide from a liquid and/or gas. There is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for processing, transportation, disposal, or storage of sulfur from a liquid and/or gas. There is a further need in the art for improved systems and methods for enhanced oil recovery. There is a further need in the art for improved systems and methods for enhanced oil recovery using a sulfur compound, for example through viscosity reduction, chemical effects, and miscible flooding. There is a further need in the art for improved systems and methods for making sulfur containing enhanced oil recovery agents.\nIn addition, carbon disulfide is a common chemical with applications ranging from use as a commercial solvent to raw material for the production of rayon and agricultural insecticides. The carbon disulfide manufacturing process involves the purchase and transport of both solid sulfur and natural gas (or another carbon source), often from long distances, to the manufacturing site and produces carbon disulfide at very high purity. These two factors\u2014the high purchase and shipping costs of the raw materials, and the high purity of the final product\u2014result in a relatively high production cost for carbon disulfide.\nThe manufacturing process for converting sour gas into solid sulfur involves a solvent unit to first remove hydrogen sulfide, other sulfur compounds, and contaminants such as carbon dioxide from the natural gas stream, followed by a Claus unit to convert the hydrogen sulfide into sulfur, which is then allowed to solidify prior to transport. The manufacturing process for manufacturing carbon disulfide, on the other hand, entails the heating, melting, and vaporization of solid sulfur and reacting its vapors with heated natural gas or another carbon source.\nThere is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for converting sour gas to sulfur. There is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for carbon disulfide manufacturing. There is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for more energy efficient carbon disulfide manufacturing.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a system comprising a mechanism for recovering oil and/or gas from an underground formation, the oil and/or gas comprising one or more sulfur compounds; a mechanism for converting at least a portion of the sulfur compounds from the recovered oil and/or gas into a carbon disulfide formulation; and a mechanism for releasing at least a portion of the carbon disulfide formulation into the formation.\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method comprising recovering oil and/or gas from an underground formation, the oil and/or gas comprising at least one sulfur compound; converting at least a portion of the sulfur compound from the recovered oil and/or gas into a carbon disulfide formulation; and releasing at least a portion of the carbon disulfide formulation into the formation.\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method comprising oxidizing a first portion of a sulfur compound in a first reaction zone to yield sulfur dioxide; reacting at least a portion of the sulfur dioxide with a second portion of sulfur compound in a second reaction zone to yield sulfur; and reacting at least a portion of the sulfur with one or more hydrocarbons in a third reaction zone to yield a carbon disulfide formulation.\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a system for producing oil and/or gas comprising a mechanism for recovering oil and/or gas from a first underground formation, the oil and/or gas comprising one or more sulfur compounds; a mechanism for converting at least a portion of the sulfur compounds from the recovered oil and/or gas into a carbon disulfide formulation; and a mechanism for releasing at least a portion of the carbon disulfide formulation into a second underground formation.\nAdvantages of the invention include one or more of the following:\nImproved systems and methods for disposing of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, and/or other sulfur based compounds.\nImproved systems and methods for enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons from a formation with a carbon disulfide formulation.\nImproved systems and methods for enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons from a formation with a fluid containing a carbon disulfide formulation.\nImproved systems and methods for producing a carbon disulfide formulation.\nImproved carbon disulfide formulations containing compositions for secondary recovery of hydrocarbons.\nImproved systems and methods for processing, transportation, disposal, or storage of a sulfur compound from a liquid and/or gas.\nImproved systems and methods for enhanced oil recovery.\nImproved systems and methods for enhanced oil recovery using a sulfur compound.\nImproved systems and methods for enhanced oil recovery using a compound which is miscible with oil in place.\nImproved systems and methods for making and/or using sulfur containing enhanced oil recovery agents.\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 illustrates an oil and/or gas production system.\nFIG. 1 illustrates an oil and/or gas production process.\nFIGS. 3a-3d illustrate oil and/or gas production systems.\nFIG. 4 illustrates a carbon disulfide formulation production process.\nFIG. 5 illustrates a carbon disulfide formulation production process.\nFIG. 6 illustrates a carbon disulfide formulation production process.\nFIG. 7 illustrates an oil and/or gas production system.\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\nIn one embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed a system comprising a mechanism for recovering oil and/or gas from an underground formation, the oil and/or gas comprising one or more sulfur compounds; a mechanism for converting at least a portion of the sulfur compounds from the recovered oil and/or gas into a carbon disulfide formulation; and a mechanism for releasing at least a portion of the carbon disulfide formulation into the formation.

Enhanced oil recovery projects may also expand beyond the typical well spacing often tens of kilometers, therefore the range is limited only by the extent of hydrocarbon bearing reservoir in the lateral sense, typically 1 km to 250 km. In some embodiments of the invention, the underground formation is beneath a body of water, and/or the mechanism for converting is floating on the body of water, such as a production platform. In some embodiments of the invention, the system also includes a mechanism for injecting water, the mechanism adapted to inject water into the underground formation after carbon disulfide formulation has been released into the formation. In some embodiments of the invention, the mechanism for recovering comprises at least one well, the at least one well comprising a casing and/or a perforation.

In some embodiments of the invention, the carbon disulfide formulation is injected at a wellhead pressure range from 0 to 37,000 kilopascals, for example 3,500 kPa to 11,000 kPa. In some embodiments of the invention, oil, as present in the underground formation prior to the injecting the carbon disulfide compound, has an in situ viscosity from 0.14 cp to 6.0 million cp, for example a viscosity from 0.3 cp to 30,000 cp. In some embodiments of the invention, the underground formation comprises an average permeability from 0.0001 to 15 Darcies, for example a permeability from 0.001 to 1 Darcy. In some embodiments of the invention, any oil, as present in the underground formation prior to the injecting the carbon disulfide formulation, has a sulfur content from 0.5% to 5%, for example from 1% to 3%. In some embodiments of the invention, converting at least a portion of the sulfur compound comprises oxidizing a first portion of the sulfur compound with air and/or oxygen to produce sulfur dioxide; reacting the sulfur dioxide with a second portion of the sulfur compound to produce sulfur; and reacting the sulfur with a hydrocarbon to produce a carbon disulfide formulation.

Suitable methods include subsea production, surface production, primary, secondary, or tertiary production. The selection of the method used to recover the oil and/or gas from the underground formation is not critical.\nIn one embodiment, oil and/or gas with a sulfur compound may be recovered from a formation into a well, and flow through the well and flowline to a facility. In some embodiments, enhanced oil recovery, with the use of an agent for example steam, water, a surfactant, a polymer flood, and/or a miscible agent such as a carbon disulfide formulation, may be used to increase the flow of oil and/or gas from the formation.\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the sulfur compound may include hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, sulfides and disulfides other than hydrogen disulfide, or heterocyclic sulfur compounds for example thiophenes, benzothiophenes, or substituted and condensed ring dibenzothiophenes, or mixtures thereof.\nThe conversion of at least a portion of the sulfur compound into a carbon disulfide formulation may be accomplished by any known method. Suitable methods may include oxidation reaction of the sulfur compound to sulfur and/or sulfur dioxides, and by reaction of sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide with carbon and/or a carbon containing compound to form the carbon disulfide formulation. The selection of the method used to convert at least a portion of the sulfur compound into a carbon disulfide formulation is not critical.\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the carbon disulfide formulation may include carbon disulfide and/or carbon disulfide derivatives for example, thiocarbonates, xanthates and mixtures thereof; and optionally one or more of the following: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof.\nIn some embodiments of the invention, carbon disulfide formulation production may have an input of a sulfur compound, for example directly from the formation, or after being separated.\nIn some embodiments, at least a portion of the sulfur compound may be separated from other gases and/or liquids from the formation, prior to the oxidation process. Suitable separation processes include solvent extraction, using a scavenging agent, liquefying and isolating the sulfur compound by compression and cooling, or other known separation methods. Sulfur compounds recovered from the oil and/or gas may be sent to a carbon disulfide formulation production facility, where the sulfur compounds may be converted to a carbon disulfide formulation.\nIn some embodiments, the sulfur compound may be removed by solvent extraction, with possible regeneration and recycle of the solvent. Solvents for such extraction include an amine solvent, for example an aqueous solution of secondary and tertiary amine, for example diisopropylamine (DIPA), methyldiethanolamine and triethanolamine (TEA). The oil and/or gas may be contacted with the amine solvent at relatively low temperatures to remove the sulfur compound. This step produces a rich amine portion, loaded with the sulfur compound. This rich amine may be passed to a stripper/regenerator, for example a tray type column. The solvent may then be heated to give off a concentrated sulfur compound gas, leaving a lean amine portion that may be recycled as fresh amine solvent. The sulfur compound rich concentrated acid gas may be routed to the oxidation process. In some embodiments, the sulfur compound may be separated by liquefying the sulfur compound. U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,344 discloses that acid gas, containing hydrogen sulfide, may be liquified by compression and cooling, mixed with water under pressure and flowed into a disposal well. U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments the mixture may also contain a lanthanide metal or metal oxide. The mixture may be supported on a lanthanide, for example samarium, coated refractory support.\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the oxidation reaction may take place in a reaction zone having a temperature of less than about 500\u00b0 C., for example from about 150 to about 500\u00b0 C., or from about 200 to about 300\u00b0 C., or above the dew point of sulfur, for given process conditions, so that sulfur does not condense onto the catalyst or in the reaction zone.\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the oxidation reaction may take place in a reaction zone having a pressure from about 100 to about 1000 kilopascals, for example from about 200 to about 500 kilopascals (absolute).\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the contact time between the catalytic surfaces of the catalyst and the sulfur compound may be maintained from about 1 to about 200 milliseconds, for example from about 5 to about 50 milliseconds, or from about 10 to about 20 milliseconds.\nIn some embodiments, a sulfur compound may be converted to sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide, for which processes are disclosed in U.S. patent application publication numbers 2004/0096381, 2004/0022721, 2004/0159583, 2003/0194366, 2001/0008619, 2002/0134706, 2004/0096381, 2004/0022721, 2004/0159583, and 2001/0008619, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\nIn some embodiments, when the sulfur compound is hydrogen sulfide, the hydrogen sulfide may converted into sulfur by the following reaction sequence:\n\nH2S+(n/2M)\u2192Mn/2S+H2 \n\nMn/2S\u2192(n/2M)+S\n\nwhere M represents a suitable metal, for example iron, cobalt, nickel, bismuth or molybdenum.

No. 4,543,434, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, oxidation reaction products, for example sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide, may be removed from the reaction zone, by techniques known in the art. For liquid reaction mixtures, oxidation reaction products may be removed by distillation or stripping. For gaseous reaction mixtures, oxidation reaction products may be removed by solvent extraction using an aqueous amine solution or an alkaline solution, or by absorption on copper, barium or cerium oxide.\nSulfur and/or sulfur dioxide may be reacted with carbon or a carbon containing compound in a reaction zone to produce a carbon disulfide formulation. In some embodiments, the products, for example carbon disulfide formulation and other sulfur compounds, may be separated into carbon disulfide formulation and sulfur compound portions, and the sulfur compound portion recycled to be oxidized and/or combined with a carbon compound.\nIn some embodiments, the carbon compound comprises carbon in any form, for example graphite, coal, charcoal, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons for example natural gas, methane, ethane, propane, or heavier hydrocarbons.\nIn some embodiments, sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide may be combined with a carbon compound at temperatures from about 500 to about 900\u00b0 C., for example from about 550 to 700\u00b0 C.\nIn some embodiments, sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide may be combined with a carbon compound at a pressure from about 100 to about 500 kilopascals.\nIn some embodiments, a carbon disulfide formulation generation may take place by the Folkins process, for example as disclosed at pages 747-749 of the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Vol. 4, 1978, herein incorporated by reference.\nIn some embodiments, an excess of sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide (e.g. 10-15% stoichiometric excess) may be used with respect to the carbon compound.\nIn some embodiments, the carbon compound may be fed countercurrent to the sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide so that the components may collide head-on.\nIn some embodiments, sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide may be combined with a carbon compound in the presence of a catalyst. Suitable catalysts include silica-alumina catalysts, for example those containing from 2 to 10 percent by weight of silica; silica gel; fuller's earth; bauxite; activated alumina; and in general those types of clay which are effective in the removal of color bodies and gum forming bodies from petroleum oils. The catalysts may additionally comprise one or more of vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, technetium, rhenium, iron, ruthenium, osmium, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, and/or platinum; in their elemental form, as compounds of the metals, or as oxides and sulfides. For example, oxides and sulfides of iron, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and manganese may be used as promoters in combination with silica gel, fuller's earth and/or activated alumina catalysts.\nIn some embodiments, the product from the reaction zone may be heat exchanged with the carbon compound, to cool the product and to heat the carbon compound.\nIn some embodiments, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide may be reacted to form a carbon disulfide formulation. The process may include a first reaction step wherein sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide are reacted in the presence of a catalyst to form carbonyl sulfide and carbon dioxide. In a second reaction step, the carbonyl sulfide may be converted over a catalyst to carbon disulfide formulation and carbon dioxide in a disproportionation reaction. The reactions can be represented by the following equations:\n\n3CO+SO2\u2192COS+2CO2 \n\n2COS\u2192CS2+CO2 \n\nThese two equations can be combined to give the following equation, which may represent the overall process.\n\n6CO+2SO2\u2192CS2+5CO2 \n\nThe reaction may be driven to completion by removal of the carbon disulfide formulation. The first reaction step may be promoted by a catalyst of the type containing a reducible metal oxide, for example chromium promoted iron catalyst, nickel-molybdenum, cobalt-molybdenum, molybdenum or any combination thereof. The first reaction is highly exothermic. A substantial quantity of heat may be removed from the reaction to control the temperature. The reaction may be conducted in a shell-and-tube reactor, a fluidized bed reactor, or a molten salt reactor. The heat that is recovered from this first reaction step may be advantageously used in the second step or other parts of the process. The second reaction step may be reversible. Carbon disulfide formulation may be recovered from the reactor effluent and the unreacted carbonyl sulfide recycled. Alternatively, carbon disulfide formulation may be continuously removed by absorption in a solvent, for example in a reactor-absorber column. The column may contain catalyst particles which also serve as the tower packing. Thus, the catalyst not only promotes the reaction but in addition may provide the surface area for contact between the liquid absorbent and the gas phase. The exit gases from the first reaction step may be fed to the bottom of the reactor-absorber column. This gas may contain carbonyl sulfide. As the gas passes up through the column, carbonyl sulfide may be converted to carbon disulfide formulation and carbon dioxide. The carbon disulfide formulation may be continuously absorbed in a solvent, which flows down the column. Thus, as the gases continue to pass up through the column, the concentration of carbonyl sulfide declines and approaches zero, leaving only carbon dioxide. The solvent, which exits the bottom of the column impregnated with carbon disulfide formulation, may be regenerated in a stripper column and recycled back to the reactor-absorber column. High void fractions may be used to minimize flooding in countercurrent flow operations. Catalysts for the decomposition of carbonyl sulfide to carbon disulfide formulation and carbon dioxide may include activated alumina, silica-alumina, quartz, glass, titania and alumina-titania composites, and/or kaolin. The absorbent may be a good solvent for carbon disulfide formulation, have a low vapor pressure, and/or be stable at elevated temperatures, for example synthetic organic fluids and silicone oils. Temperatures from about 50 to about 250\u00b0 C. may be used with pressure in the range of 100 to 1000 kilopascals.\nIn some embodiments, a carbon disulfide formulation may be produced by reacting elemental carbon with sulfur. Elemental carbon may be obtained from methane, which may be thermally decomposed to carbon and hydrogen in the absence of oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds, to ensure that no methane conversion to oxygenates can take place. The hydrogen may be collected for separate use. The heat required for this decomposition reaction could be supplied in any desirable form. It is possible that a catalytic surface may be used to enhance the decomposition reaction and thus reduce the fuel requirements of the reaction. Sulfur may be reacted with the freshly generated carbon so as to produce carbon disulfide formulation, for example, sulfur in the vapor phase may be used for this reaction. The methane decomposition reaction and the reaction with sulfur may both take place in the same reaction zone, wherein elemental carbon may be deposited on a solid surface as a product of the decomposition reaction. After the carbon deposited by the decomposition reaction is removed from the reactor by the reaction with sulfur, the introduction of sulfur may be stopped and the cycle of methane decomposition restarted. The decomposition reaction and the reaction with sulfur could also be conducted with a carrier solid in transported bed or fluidized bed reactor systems.\nIn some embodiments, sulfur and/or sulfur dioxide and a carbon compound may be converted to carbon disulfide formulation, processes for which are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,963,340, 2,636,810, 3,927,185, 4,057,613, and 4,822,938, and U.S. patent application publication number 2004/0146450, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\nIn some embodiments of the invention, carbon monoxide may be reacted with sulfur dioxide to form carbon disulfide formulation, a process for which is disclosed in U.S. patent application publication number 2004/0146450, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\nIn some embodiments to accomplish Step 2, carbon disulfide formulation may be reacted with other chemicals to form carbon disulfide derivatives, for example thiocarbonates, xanthates, and/or dithiocarbamates, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,476,113 and 5,076,358, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\nReleasing at least a portion of the carbon disulfide formulation and/or other liquids and/or gases may be accomplished by any known method. One suitable method is injecting carbon disulfide formulation into a single conduit in a single well, allowing carbon disulfide formulation to soak, and then pumping out at least a portion of the carbon disulfide formulation with gas and/or liquids. Another suitable method is injecting carbon disulfide formulation into a first conduit in a single well, and pumping out at least a portion of the carbon disulfide formulation with gas and/or liquids through a second conduit in the single well.

In some embodiments, a quantity of carbon disulfide formulation or carbon disulfide formulation mixed with other components may be injected into a well, followed by another component to force carbon disulfide formulation or carbon disulfide formulation mixed with other components across the formation. For example air, water in liquid or vapor form, carbon dioxide, other gases, other liquids, and/or mixtures thereof may be used to force carbon disulfide formulation or carbon disulfide formulation mixed with other components across the formation.\nIn some embodiments, carbon disulfide formulation, for example thiocarbonate compounds, may be dissolved in water, and the resulting solution pumped into a formation. The dissolved thiocarbonate compounds may decompose, yielding carbon disulfide in the formation.\nIn some embodiments to accomplish Step 3, carbon disulfide formulation is combined with one or more hydrocarbons: such as an aromatic, for example, benzene, toluene, or xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example, carbon tetrachloride or methylene chloride; other C5-C15 hydrocarbons, such as gasoline; diesel; mineral oils other naphthenic or paraffinic hydrocarbons; water or steam; or other sulfur compounds, for example, hydrogen sulfide, and then injected into a formation for enhanced oil recovery. For example, a mixture of carbon disulfide formulation, hydrogen sulfide, and water may be injected into a formation.\nIn some embodiments, carbon disulfide formulation or a carbon disulfide formulation mixture may be injected into a formation, produced from the formation, and then separated from the recovered oil and/or gas, for example, by boiling and then condensing, then the carbon disulfide formulation or carbon disulfide formulation mixture may be re-injected into the formation.\nIn some embodiments, carbon disulfide formulation or a carbon disulfide formulation mixture may be heated prior to being injected into the formation to lower the viscosity of fluids in the formation, for example heavy oils, paraffins, asphaltenes, etc.\nIn some embodiments, carbon disulfide formulation or a carbon disulfide formulation mixture may be heated and/or boiled while within the formation, with the use of a heated fluid or a heater, to lower the viscosity of fluids in the formation. In some embodiments, heated water and/or steam may be used to heat and/or vaporize the carbon disulfide formulation in the formation. Alternatively, a nonaqueous fluid could be substituted for steam or hot water as the heat medium to vaporize carbon disulfide formulation, for example a heavy aromatic solvent which may have its own solubilizing effect on reservoir hydrocarbons.\nIn some embodiments, carbon disulfide formulation may be removed from the recovered crude and other liquids by physical separation processes, so that the carbon disulfide formulation may be reused again leaving the crude substantially free of carbon disulfide formulation.\nReferring now to FIG. 3a, in one embodiment of the invention, system 200 is illustrated.
